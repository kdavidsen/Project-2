			The season is almost over for the Mackinac Island Lakers basketball teams. Both the boys and girls Lakers squads will complete their regular season schedules this weekend with doubleheaders at home against Hannahville Friday, February 10, and Saturday, February 11. This season has been a unique one for the school’s efforts on the court, with many young players on both squads. The Northern Lights League championship tournament will follow the regular season, with the Lakers squads heading to the mainland to take part in the event.<br><br>

Mackinac Island’s boys basketball team has posted a 10-4 record so far this season leading into its final week of play. Third-year coach Justin Gallagher is calling the shots for the Lakers this year. Mr. Gallagher is pleased with how his team has played this season noting that the things the team has worked on in practice paid off this season when the team swept a weekend doubleheader against Brimley’s Ojibwe Charter School, winning the Friday game by two points and the Saturday game by just one.<br><br>

“The games were both ultracompetitive,” Mr. Gallagher said. “We put a half court trap on them. Our fundamentals clicked, we were down in both games but my players calmed down toward the end of the game and everything started going in.”<br><br>

Mr. Gallagher likes his team’s output this season, including its two victories on the road against Hannahville earlier this season that kicked off the league portion of its schedule. It marked the first time the Lakers have ever swept the Soaring Eagles on the mainland during his tenure as coach. Two conference losses to the very physical team of Maplewood Baptist Academy also proved a good learning experience.<br><br>

The Lakers have improved this season by markedly cutting back on turnovers. Mr. Gallagher said last year the team made upwards of 20 a game, but this year it has cut that number down to a single-digit total in most games. He credited the change to sharper passing and his team avoiding forcing issues in the paint when possible.<br><br>

In the closing weeks of the season, Mr. Gallagher wanted to work on his team’s boxing out efforts on defense, stopping the opposition in their tracks so their point guards won’t be able to drive around the Lakers. Mackinac Island’s youthful roster this season means its players are smaller than some other teams, leading Mr. Gallagher to bring in some local adults to help the team at practices. Former coach Jimmy Fisher and Ken Styburski have both taken to the court to help the team prepare for the bigger opposition it faces when traveling off the Island.<br><br>

Senior player Christian Styburski noted the season got off to a rough start, highlighted by a pair of losses to the school’s Ohio rival Put-in-Bay, but the team is working better together now, with the more united approach leading to more victories. Christian credits the change to improvements in passing, with the team taking better shots and passing more to set up open ones. The team worked on passing over the summer, allowing it to focus on passing this winter.<br><br>

“The more we pass, the better we do,” Christian said. “I believe we can win these next few games. We know how each other works.”<br><br>

The boys’ finale this week against Hannahville will mark the Lakers’ fifth and sixth games over the course of eight days. The team played Grand Marais last weekend, then played a rare Monday-Tuesday doubleheader against Paradise to make up some weather-postponed games from earlier. Mr. Gallagher’s goal is to get through these games with his team as healthy as possible. The Lakers have had a hard season with regard to injuries; any sidelined player is a big loss for a team with five high school starters and a bench consisting only of middle school players.<br><br>

“We’ve battled to stay healthy,” Mr. Gallagher said.<br><br>

The girls basketball team has had a learning season with a 2- 10 record as the end of the year approaches. Mary Patay is serving as the team’s coach for the ninth season this year. The Lakers have a young roster with just two high school students, junior Cheyla Shunk and freshman Hannah Styburski, among its six players.<br><br>

“All of my players made the honor roll this year,” Dr. Patay said. “We’re an all-academic team.”<br><br>

Dr. Patay said her team’s best games this season have been its wins against its rivals from Beaver Island and Put-in-Bay. The team also played well in a scrimmage against Burt Lake Northern Michigan Christian Academy that was held after a scheduling mix-up meant the planned regular game between the two schools did not come to pass. Dr. Patay said although the Lakers lost the scrimmage by five points, the team played strongly throughout the second half and it marked a turning point for the team, as it really started to click with the girls starting to get more comfortable in their roles.<br><br>

Dr. Patay is pleased with her team’s improvement this season, with her players maturing on the court as they gain more experience. She said her players’ skills regarding defense, dribbling, and driving to the basket have all gotten better as the season goes on. The Lakers continue to improve following rebuilding seasons in recent years; the team had only five players total in 2015-2016 and fielded a team with three seniors last season.<br><br>

“We’ve struggled the last few years, so it’s good to see the team turning around,” Dr. Patay said.<br><br>

Player Ella Cowell, an eighth grader, said the Lakers’ teamwork skills have improved throughout the season. She said the team is working much better together.<br><br>

“We are doing good for how young our team is,” Ella said, noting she also looks forward to the conclusion of the season and the arrival of the new challenges spring sports will bring.<br><br>

Dr. Patay still wants her team to work on its shooting, defense, rebounding, and boxing out as the season winds down. She is looking forward to the rematch finale with Hannahville this weekend, noting the games will be a great chance to see how much the Lakers have improved since they lost two on the road to the Soaring Eagles in December. The Lakers’ trip to Hannahville for the conference tournament will be followed by a matchup with Cedarville in the state’s district championship playoffs. The game will be Wednesday, March 1, in Pickford. </div>

			<div class='abodytext'>The Northern Lights League named Mackinac Island Lakers players Cheyla Shunk and Ella Cowell as second-team all-conference volleyball players for their play during the fall sports season. The all-conference teams were compiled by all of the coaches in the league. Maplewood Baptist Academy junior Grace May was named as the league’s player of the year and headed up the first team alongside her Black Bears teammate Olivia Mulder, Munising Baptist’s Joslyn LaFlamme and Megan Tufnell, and Hannahville’s Lena Philemon and Ruby Troxell. Maplewood Baptist’s Madyson Pollman, Beaver Island’s Katie LaFreniere, Munising Baptist’s Alissa Exelby, and Ojibwe Charter School’s Lily Parish joined Shunk and Cowell on the second team. Honorable mentions went to Beaver Island’s Sveta Stebbins and Ojibwe Charter’s Brecklin Williams. </div>

			<div class='abodytext'>It was a battle of Lake Huron versus Lake Michigan on Mackinac Island over the weekend as the Lakers girls basketball team hosted their rivals the Beaver Island Islanders. The two teams split their two games, with Mackinac Island edging Beaver Island 34-33 Friday night, January 27, before the Islanders bounced back to top the Lakers 41-32 Saturday morning, January 28.<br><br>

Friday’s opener was a story of two halves. Mackinac Island controlled the game early on as the Lakers outscored the Islanders 7-6 in the first quarter and 14-8 in the second to lead 21-14 at halftime. Beaver Island rallied back to outscore the Mackinac Island in the second half as it bested its opponent 12-7 in the third and held a 7-6 edge in the fourth. The Lakers held on to squeak out a one-point win. Hannah Styburski, Cheyla Shunk, and Ella Cowell each scored 10 points to lead the Lakers, with Hannah also pulling down 13 rebounds to record a double-double.<br><br>

Saturday’s game saw Beaver Island strike fast in the first half as they outscored Mackinac Island 12-8 in the first quarter and 16-5 in the second, leading 28-13 at halftime. The two teams each scored seven points in the third quarter with the Lakers holding doubling up the Islanders 12-6 in the fourth, although it was not enough to avoid defeat. Hannah Styburski, Shunk, and Cowell again all led the Mackinac Island offense with eight points apiece.</div>

			The Mackinac Island boys basketball team is riding high in the closing days of its 2016-17 season. The Lakers won four games in a row at home from Friday, February 3, to Tuesday, February 7, as they scored a pair of victories against both Grand Marais, triumphing with scores of 50-38 and 53-38, and Paradise, winning 45-40 and 51-30. The victories extend the team’s winning streak to 12 games, dating back to its early January loss against Maplewood Baptist Academy, while improving their overall record to 14-4.<br><br>

The Lakers roster features both high school and middle school aged players. The younger members of the team got a lot of playing time throughout the home stand.<br><br>

“These games went as well as they could go,” Mackinac Island Coach Justin Gallagher said. “It’s so good for our program that we can get our middle school players out there right now. They can get the jitters out now, before they reach high school.”<br><br>

The opening game against the co-ed Grand Marais Friday, February 3, saw the Lakers win 50- 38. Mackinac Island held a narrow 14-11 lead after the first quarter, but pulled away as the game went on, leading 29-19 at the half. The Lakers extended their lead by 13 points in the third quarter, but the Polar Bears would come back to outscore them 17-6 in the fourth. Nick Davis was the team’s leading scorer with 19 points, while Christian Styburski recorded a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds.<br><br>

The second game saw the Lakers open up a 20-6 lead in the first quarter, but the Polar Bears roar back to narrow the margin to 26- 20 at halftime. Mackinac Island retook control of the game with a 17-7 edge in the third quarter that balanced out Grand Marais outscoring them 11-10 in the fourth. Styburski and Davis were again statistical leaders for the team, with each recording a double double despite only playing two quarters. Styburski had 18 points and 17 rebounds, while Davis had 18 points and 10 rebounds.<br><br>

This week began with a rare Monday-Tuesday doubleheader against Paradise to make up a pair of games delayed by weather earlier. The opening game Monday, February 6, saw Mackinac Island open up a 26-9 lead in the first quarter before handing over control of the ball to its middle school players. The Lakers held a 39-20 edge at the end of the first half while letting up on the reins in the second. The Rockets would close the gap throughout the second half, but never took the lead away as the Lakers prevailed 45-40. Eighth grader Dominic Morse was the team’s leading scorer as he recorded 13 points. Davis was also in double figures with 11 points. Eighth grader Albert Mosley pulled down eight rebounds while adding seven points to the scoreboard.<br><br>

The Tuesday, February 7, game saw Mackinac Island’s middle school players again play the majority of the game. The Lakers led 30-13 at the half on their way to victory. Davis led the Lakers’ offense with 12 points while Morse and Styburski each added seven.<br><br>

“That is probably the best play I’ve seen from my seventh and eighth graders,” Mr. Gallagher said. “We had our younger players in for the second, third, and fourth quarters.”</div>
